# Browser Tools

A collection of browser-based HTML+JavaScript tools for various tasks. These tools are prototypes, not products. They have been developed quickly and iteratively using LLMs to test the afforances and limitations of agentic coding. Each tool has been tailored to my own practical needs. At the same time they are also intended to provide genuine utility and value for others.

Some tools require external dependencies which are loaded from trusted CDNs. All tools run entirely in your browser with no server-side processing.

## Features

- 🚀 No server-side processing required
- 🔒 All data stays in your browser
- 📱 Works on any modern browser
- 🔍 Search functionality to find tools quickly

## Usage

Navigate to [https://virtualarchitectures.github.io/Browser-Tools/](https://virtualarchitectures.github.io/Browser-Tools/) in your browser to access the tools.

## Acknowledgements

Development of this collection was inspired by Simon Willison's experiments in prompt-driven development. Simon's collection can be found at [https://tools.simonwillison.net/](https://tools.simonwillison.net/), and his code can be found on GitHub in [simonw/tools](https://github.com/simonw/tools). Simon also generously discusses both the [Claude custom instructions](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/#custom-instructions) and [general patterns](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/) he uses for developing these tools on his blog.

The majority of tools in my collection [virtualarchitectures/Browser-Tools](https://github.com/virtualarchitectures/Browser-Tools) have been developed using Anthropic's Claude Code. In each case I've worked with the LLM to tailor the tool to meet my own practical needs. This practice is broadly aligned with concepts of [malleable software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/) and [resonant computing](https://resonantcomputing.org/).

My own personal preference for the further development of LLMs is oriented toward the implementation of capable, task specific, open weight models which can be run privately and locally using frameworks like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).
