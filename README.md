## Acknowledgement

This set of tools has been developed using a range of agentic coding tools. This collection was inspired by Simon Willison's experiment in prompt-driven development, using LLMs to develop his own set of standalone HTML + Javascript tools. Simon's code lives on GitHub in [simonw/tools](https://github.com/simonw/tools) and many of his tools used the Claude custom instructions [described here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/#custom-instructions).
